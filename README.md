# 🐍 100 Days of Python – Project Repository

This repository documents my **100 Days of Python learning journey**, where I work on Python projects whenever possible and continuously improve my coding skills.

While I may not code every single day, I consistently return to learning, practicing, and building projects — focusing on **progress over perfection**.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Develop a strong foundation in Python
- Learn through **hands-on projects**
- Build problem-solving skills gradually
- Track learning progress over time
- Maintain consistency, even if not daily

This repository reflects **effort, learning, and improvement**, not rigid timelines.
